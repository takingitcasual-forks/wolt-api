## Usage

-     npm install
-     npm start
- The server runs on port 3000, so `localhost:3000/restaurants/search?q=sushi&lat=60.17045&lon=24.93147` would used to access the API.

## Notes

- Validating blurhashes was attempted, but encoding the images gave different blurhashes than were described in the JSON file. The validation code has been included regardless.
